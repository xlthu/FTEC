    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing is susceptible to environmental interference, thus quantum error correction and fault-tolerant techniques are proposed for practical quantum computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum error correction uses an error-correcting code (such as Steane Code) to protect computational qubits, which encodes the computational qubits into a bundle of qubits (called logical qubits or *codewords*) and preforms an error correction procedure in case of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error correction procedure, in the theory of quantum error correction, is assumed to carry out perfectly, i.e., no more errors will happen during error correction. Obviously, it is an unrealistic assumption. To put the theory into practice, fault-tolerant techniques are proposed and applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we discuss a fault-tolerant error correction scheme, the Steane Error Correction scheme, and verify its fault-tolerant property by applying it to error correction in a faulty simulated environment. We use Steane Code as the error-correcting code in this tutorial, but the Steane Error Correction scheme can work on any Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first summarize some background knowledge about Steane Code and present a theoretical implementation of its error correcting procedure according to the theory of quantum error correction. Then we explain the error propagation problem in the theoretical implementation to reveal why fault tolerance is necessary. We next present the definition and the requirements of fault-tolerant quantum error correction, elaborate the Steane Error Correction scheme along with its Q# implementation and finally verify that the scheme satisfies the fault-tolerant requirements."

    "Steane Code is a $[[ 7,1,3 ]]$ stabilizer code and also a CSS code. It means that Steane Code uses $7$ qubits to encode $1$ computational qubit and the minimal distance $d$ between two valid codewords is $3$. Steane Code can correct single qubit errors ($t = \\lfloor (d - 1) / 2 \\rfloor = 1$). The parity check matrix of Steane Code is \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For classical linear codes, the parity check matrix is used to detect the type of errors by regarding the codewords as column vectors and multiplying the parity check matrix and the vector. The procedure of detection is called *syndrome computation*, and the result of computation is a bit-string called *syndrome*. We then correct errors according to the syndrome via a mapping from syndromes to error correcting operations. We refer to the whole procedure including detecting and correcting as *error correction*.\n",

    "For quantum stabilizer codes, replacing $1$ in the parity check matrix with $X$($Z$) and $0$ with $I$, we will get its stabilizers. The stabilizers of Steane Code are:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A valid codeword is a +1-eigenstate of all the stabilizers. Measuring the codeword using these stabilizers can detect the type of errors (syndrome computation). For Steane Code, the result of measurement is a 6 bit-string (syndrome). The \n",

    "Usually, we need a lookup table to enumerate the mapping from syndromes to error correcting operations. For Steane Code, there are $2^6 - 1 = 63$ types of errors. (All 0 syndrome means no error.) But for CSS codes, we have another view of the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $Z$-generators ($S_{4,5,6}$) detects bit flip errors. Measuring these $Z$-generators yields a 3 bit-string for $2^3 - 1 = 7$ types of errors, which corresponds to a bit flip of a certain qubit of the 7-qubit codewords. Similarly, the $X$-generators detects phase flip errors. Therefore, for CSS codes, we can separate the whole error correction into two, one for correcting bit flip errors, and another for phase flip errors.\n",

    "The theoretical implementation exploits the property of Steane Code as a stabilizer code. It uses measurement of stabilizers to get syndromes and the type of errors. Instead, Steane Error Correction exploits more about the property of Steane Code as a CSS code, which uses a different way of syndrome computation, thereby mitigating the error propagation problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Shor Error Correction scheme achieves fault-tolerance by modifying the theoretical implementation, readers can refer to [1], [4] for more details. Since *Shor error correction is rather laborious, requiring many extra gates and a low physical error rate to work well* [1], we choose to elaborate another scheme, Stean Error Correction, in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Steane Code as a CSS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSS Code $[[n, k_1 - k_2]]$ is constructed from two classical dual codes $C_1$ and $C_2$ where 1) $C_1$ and $C_2$ are $[n, k_1]$, $[n, k_2]$ classical linear codes, 2) $C_2 \\subset C_1$, and 3) $C_1$ and $C_2^\\bot$ each can correct errors of weight at most $t$. E.g. Steane Code is a $[[7, 1]]$ CSS Code constructed from $[7, 4]$ and $[7, 3]$ classical Hamming codes.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $u \\in C_1$ reveals the logical codeword encoded the state. Thus, if we were to measure every qubits of the codeword, we will get the classical result $u + w$ for a random $w \\in C_2^\\bot$. In case of errors, the result will be $u + w + e$ where $e$ represents the type of errors. Since $u + w \\in C_1$ is a classical codeword, we can apply the classical syndrome computation to detect errors by multiplying the parity check matrix and the result.\n",

    "### 6.2 Steane Error Correction Scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "For gates between two qubits, we can define its *transversal* gate between two blocks of qubits. A transversal gate is constructed by applying the original gate between corresponding qubits of the two blocks. E.g. The transversal CNOT between two blocks of 3 qubit each, $|q_{0-2}\\rangle$ to $|a_{0-2}\\rangle$, is defined as:\n",

    "\n",
    "The circuit of Steane Error Correction is shown as follows.\n",
    "\n",

    "$|q_{0-6}\\rangle$ and $|a_{0-6}\\rangle$ each is a block of 7 qubits, and the CNOT in the circuit are transversal CNOT between the two blocks. H, Measure and C are applied to every qubit in the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the theoretical implementation, Steane Error Correction detects and corrects bit flip errors and phase flip errors separately. The left part of the circuit is used to deal with bit flip errors and the right part is for phase flip errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For bit flip errors, we first prepare a logical $|\\overline{+}\\rangle$ state for the ancilla block (A logical $|\\overline{+}\\rangle$ state is a $|+\\rangle$ state encoded by Steane Code) and perform transversal CNOT from the codeword to the ancilla block. The transversal CNOT is used to propagate bit flip errors from the codeword to the ancilla qubits. Then we measure the ancilla qubits and treat the result as a classical codeword in $C_1$. We perform the classical syndrome computation $\\cal{M}_c$, deduce the location of errors and then correct it on the codeword ($\\cal{C}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "For phase flip errors, we prepare a logical $|\\overline{0}\\rangle$ state and perform a similar correction procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why such scheme is fault-tolerant lies in the use of transversal CNOT gates. We explain from the view of error propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, except for the transversal CNOT gates, all other operations are single qubit operations, which means that errors taking place during the operation can only affect the qubit itself, but not other qubits. Thus, single qubit operations will not propagate errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, transversal CNOT gates are performed between corresponding qubits of two blocks, and more importantly, within each block, no qubit are used twice. Even errors are propagated to the other block via CNOT operations, only one qubit within each block will be affected. This is vital because we perform error correction at the granularity of block, and single qubit errors in a block can be corrected by Steane Code. In contrast, the ancilla qubits in the theoretical implementation are used in multiple CNOT operations, and thus errors can be spread to multiple qubits within one block using the common ancilla qubits as bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readers can refer to [1] and [2] fore more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Fault-tolerant State Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the theoretical implementation where the initial state of ancilla qubits is $|0\\rangle$, we need logical $|\\overline{+}\\rangle$ and $|\\overline{0}\\rangle$ to initialize the ancilla qubits in the Steane Error Correction scheme. As we see before, the encoding operation involves many two qubit operations so that a single error during encoding may cause many qubit errors in the final codeword. If we use wrong initial states for ancilla qubits, it may not only perform a wrong error correction but also destroy the information stored in the computational qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we need fault-tolerant state preparation for these ancilla qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways for fault-tolerant state preparation, and Gottesman proposed a *trial-and-error* method which reuses the above error correction procedure [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first prepare the target state (e.g. the logical $|\\overline{+}\\rangle$) using the encoding function.\n",
    "2. Then we perform the above error correction procedure on the prepared state, but we use the procedure only to find if there is any error in the prepared state, not to correct it.\n",
    "3. If we find any error, we simply discard the prepared state and repeat the above steps until no error is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, in step 2, since we reuse the same error correction procedure, we also need to prepare initial states for the ancilla qubits. But for this time, we simply use the encoding function to prepare these states and do no further verification. We explain the reason as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting with unverified ancilla qubits may get wrong results, but in order for a wrong prepared state to pass the detection, we need correlated errors both on the prepared states and the ancilla qubits, and these errors must take place in a *right* way that they succeed to hide themselves in the syndrome.\n",
